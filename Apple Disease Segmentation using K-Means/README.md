## Apple Disease Segmentation using K-Means

#### Monitoring of health and detection of diseases is critical in fruits and trees for sustainable agriculture. Fruit diseases can cause significant losses in yield and quality appeared in harvesting. An early detection of fruit diseasescan aid in decreasing such losses and can stop further spread of diseases. A lot of work has been done to automate the visual inspection of the fruits by machine vision with respect to size and color.

Here we take an example of apples. Some common diseases of apple fruits are apple scab, apple rot, and apple blotch (Hartman, 2010). Apple scabs are gray or brown corky spots. Apple rot infections produce slightly sunken, circular brown or black spots that may be covered by a red halo. Apple blotch is a fungal disease and appears on the surface of the fruit as dark, irregular or lobed edges. With some image processing and some advanced image segmentation I was able to identify the disease type and visualize the disease segment.
